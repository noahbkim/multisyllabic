    <h2>University-Wide Policies</h2>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>
  Standards of academic conduct are set forth in the university’s Academic Integrity Code.
  By registering for this course, students have acknowledged their awareness of the Academic Integrity Code and they are obliged to become familiar with their rights and responsibilities as defined by the Code.
  Violations of the Academic Integrity Code will not be treated lightly and disciplinary action will be taken should violations occur. This includes cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism.
</p>
<h3>Defining and Reporting Discrimination and Harassment (Title IX)</h3>
<p>
  American University expressly prohibits any form of discrimination and discriminatory harassment including sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.
  The University is an equal opportunity, affirmative action institution that operates in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
  AU does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), age, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, personal appearance, gender identity and expression, family responsibilities, political affiliation, source of income, veteran status, an individual's genetic information, or any other bases under federal or local laws in its programs and activities.
</p>
<p>
  As a faculty member, I am required to report discriminatory or harassing conduct to the university if I witness it or become aware of it – regardless of the location of the incident.
  There are four confidential resource on campus if you wish to speak to someone who is not required to report: Counseling Center, victim advocates in OASIS, medical providers in the Student Health Center, and ordained clergy in the Kay Spiritual Life Center.
  If you experience any of the above, you have the option of filing a report with University Police (202-885-2527), the Office of the Dean of Students (<a href="mailto:dos@american.edu">dos@american.edu</a> or 202-885-3300), or the Title IX Office (202-885-3373 or <a href="mailto:TitleIX@american.edu">TitleIX@american.edu</a>).
  For more information, including a list of supportive resources on and off-campus, contact OASIS (<a href="mailto:oasis@american.edu">oasis@american.edu</a> or 202-885-7070) or check out the <a href="https://www.american.edu/ocl/titleix/support.cfm">Support Guide on the Title IX webpage</a>.
</p>
<h3>Emergency Preparedness</h3>
<p>
  In the event of an emergency, American University will implement a plan for meeting the needs of all members of the university community.
  Should the University be required to close for a period of time, we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of our educational programs will be delivered to our students.
  These may include altering and extending the duration of the traditional term schedule to complete essential instruction in the traditional format and/or the use of distance instructional methods.
  Specific strategies will vary from class to class, depending on the format of the course and the timing of the emergency.
  Faculty will communicate class-specific information to students via AU email and Blackboard, while students must inform their faculty immediately of any emergency-related absence.
  Students are responsible for checking their AU email regularly and keeping themselves informed of emergencies.
  In the event of an emergency, students should refer to the AU Student Portal, the <a href="https://www.american.edu/emergency/">AU website</a>, and the AU information line at (202) 885-1100 for general university-wide information, as well as contact their faculty and/or respective dean’s office for course and school/college specific information.
</p>
<h3>Incomplete Policy</h3>
<p>
  At the discretion of the faculty member and before the end of the semester, the grade of I (Incomplete) may be given to a student who, because of extenuating circumstances, is unable to complete the course during the semester.
  The grade of Incomplete may be given only if the student is receiving a passing grade for the coursework completed.
  Students on academic probation may not receive an Incomplete.
  The instructor must provide in writing to the student the conditions, which are described below, for satisfying the Incomplete and must enter those same conditions when posting the grades for the course.
  The student is responsible for verifying that the conditions were entered correctly.
</p>
<p>
  Conditions for satisfying the Incomplete must include what work needs to be completed, by when the work must be completed, and what the course grade will be if the student fails to complete that work.
  At the latest, any outstanding coursework must be completed before the end of the following semester, absent an agreement to the contrary.
  Instructors will submit the grade of I and the aforementioned conditions to the Office of the University Registrar when submitting all other final grades for the course.
  If the student does not meet the conditions, the Office of the University Registrar will assign the default grade automatically.
</p>
<p>
  The Associate Dean of the Academic Unit, with the concurrence of the instructor, may grant an extension beyond the agreed deadline, but only in extraordinary circumstances.
  Incomplete courses may not be retroactively dropped. An Incomplete may not stand as a permanent grade and must be resolved before a degree can be awarded.
